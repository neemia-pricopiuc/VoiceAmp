# VoiceAmp
VoiceAmp is an innovative Android application designed to amplify your voice for small events and meetings. It enhances speech clarity, ensuring that your voice is easily heard by everyone in attendance.

Using your phoneâ€™s microphone, VoiceAmp captures your voice and transmits it to an external audio system. For optimal performance, we recommend connecting to a Bluetooth speaker or another dedicated audio device rather than using your phone's built-in speaker. Additionally, keeping your phone at a distance from the audio system can help minimize interference and enhance sound quality.

With VoiceAmp, you can confidently engage your audience, making every word count!
